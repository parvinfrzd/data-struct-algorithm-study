### Binary Search Tree 

1.  suppose you are given a binary search tree represented as an array. Write a function that determines whether the left or right branch of the tree is larger. The function should return "Right" if the right side is larger and "Left" if the left side is larger. If the tree is has 0 nodes or if the size of the branches are equal, return the empty string.
2.  
3.  Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
   
### Linked List 

1.  You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
2.  
3.  Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

### Hash Table

1. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
   
2. Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

### Stacks 

1.  Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
