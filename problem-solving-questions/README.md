### Binary Search Tree 

1.  suppose you are given a binary search tree represented as an array. Write a function that determines whether the left or right branch of the tree is larger. The function should return "Right" if the right side is larger and "Left" if the left side is larger. If the tree is has 0 nodes or if the size of the branches are equal, return the empty string.
   
2.  Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

3.  Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
   
### Linked List 

1.  You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
   
2.  Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
   
3. You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

    Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

    Return the head of the merged linked list.

4.  Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that    each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. (solved with two pointers. but can be also with linkedlist solution)
   
5.  Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

### Hash Table

1. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
   
2. Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

### Stacks 

1.  Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
