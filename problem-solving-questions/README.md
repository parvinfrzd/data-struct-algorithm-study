### Binary Search Tree 

1.  suppose you are given a binary search tree represented as an array. Write a function that determines whether the left or right branch of the tree is larger. The function should return "Right" if the right side is larger and "Left" if the left side is larger. If the tree is has 0 nodes or if the size of the branches are equal, return the empty string.
   
2.  Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

3.  Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
   
   

### Binary Search 

1.  You are given an array time where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith bus to complete one trip.

    Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of  one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

    You are also given an integer totalTrips, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips.

### Linked List 

1.  You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
   
2.  Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
   
3. You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

    Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

    Return the head of the merged linked list.

4.  Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that    each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. (solved with two pointers. but can be also with linkedlist solution)
   
5.  Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

6.  Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.



### Hash Table

1. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
   
2. Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

### Stacks 

1.  Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
71. Simplify Path


An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

2. A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
